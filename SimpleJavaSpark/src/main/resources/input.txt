Kedok Ketawa (The Laughing Mask) is a 1940 action film from the Dutch East Indies, in present-day Indonesia. 
After a young couple falls in love, the title character, a vigilante, helps them fight off criminals who have been sent to kidnap the woman by a rich man who wants her 
as his wife. It was the first film of Union Films, one of four new production houses 
established after the country's ailing film industry was revived by the success of Albert Balink's Terang Boelan. Kedok Ketawa was directed by Jo An Djan and stars Basoeki 
Resobowo, Fatimah, Oedjang (as the vigilante), S Poniman and Eddy Kock. Featuring fighting, comedy, and singing, and advertised as an "Indonesian cocktail of violent actions ... and sweet romance", the film received positive reviews, particularly for its cinematography. Following the success of the film, Union produced another six before being shut down in early 1942 during the Japanese occupation. Screened until at least August 1944, the film may be lost
